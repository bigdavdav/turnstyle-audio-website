# Turnstyle Audio Website
<hr />

This website was created on my Website Development unit in BTEC IT. 

Main takewaways from making this was working with cookies(pain in the ass) and also messing around with string queries. I could have probably added a SQL database but its too overkill for a BTEC IT project(VERY INSANE FORESHADOWING)

Have fun looking through this and dw about the stuff underneath this because YOU ARE NOT MR EXAMINER(i think)!!!!!!


# Hi Mr Examiner =D
<hr />

This file is here so you know how my code should be ran.

Since I am using a script type module element in most of my pages, you would need a live server to run it.
```js
<script src="file.js" type="module"></script>
```
(It looks like that)

If you do want to run this code on your machine, you can:
  - Run this on a NodeJS server(files already included) by using:
  ```shell
    user@computer:~$ npm i
    user@computer:~$ npm fund
    user@computer:~$ npx vite
  ```
  - Access the website through my GitHub page
  ```
    https://bigdavdav.github.io/BigProject/index.html
  ```

Please do enjoy looking through the website as much as I enjoyed making it!
